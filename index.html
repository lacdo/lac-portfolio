        Skinner’s Lane is a three piece indie garage rock group based in Liverpool.
        Originally hailing from the likes of California, Dorset and Cheshire, all
        three met whilst studying in university. Despite such a short time together,
        they have already supported the likes of Chase City, Fiona Grey and
        The Wild Things. The sound of the band can be described as an amalgamation
        of heavy-indie-blues influences including the likes of Franz Ferdinand,
        Black Keys, and Royal Blood.

        "The band have a natural energy and stage presence and above all created a
        feeling of fun." - LS Radio

        "With the synth based indie-pop take over in the city, it has been a while
        that a band with such intense riffs and head bobbing chorus' has graced these
        parts. Everything about these guys is infectious and you could tell how quickly
        any inhibitions from the crowd to mosh on a work night disappeared out of
        their minds." - Boot Music

        "Even though the group played their original songs, they still managed to amass
        a following of fans who have previously seen them live at venues throughout the
        city. With the riff's combined with the frontman Zack' s energy, the place filled
        fast. Through the Canadian accent and the American humour, Zack and his band
        definitely set the bar high for acts to follow." - Purple Revolver

        "Opening with Every Time, the band emitted pure energy and skill. Building up the
        music, they held the space on stage well and put on a show for all. Displaying a
        range of styles from the funky and unique Down to slow ballad Said and Been,
        Skinner’s Lane showed they’re much more than the ‘one trick pony’ acts of
        today." - Ellipsis Magazine.

        "The opening rumble of guitar and drums is reminiscent of indie gods Arctic Monkeys
        and Franz Ferdinand, whilst vocalist Zak’s singing gives a nod to classic punk pop
        tracks of the late ‘90s and early ‘00s." - Liverpool Noise.

        "Featuring unforgettable guitar riffs and quick changes between the song’s
        direction" - Ellipsis Magazine

        "The cross contamination of indie and punk genres was electrifying and inspiring.”
        - One Great Song

        In recent months, Skinner's Lane have released its debut single ‘Dear Brighton,’
        which delves into the misadventures of a Liverpool night out and the alienation
        of society. Currently the band is recording their next single as they look to continue
        their steady rise in not just the Liverpool scene, but Northwest music scene with their
        energetic, wild and driving performances.
